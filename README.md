# Password Generator


## Description


This webpage shows a password generator. The webpage has a placeholder that displays "Your secure password", and displays a random password based on user's selction. Through this project, I leared that for loops can be used to undertake repetitive tasks in JavaScript and functions, after being declared can be invoked at any part in your code to carry out the set conditions.

Then, input your prefered password length in the prompt (cannot be less than 8 characters or more than 128 characters) and click "ok" to select a character choice or "cancel" to move to the next choice without selecting. View your password in the placeholder after all choices have been made.
